      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Jnanamithran M, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science student at St. Thomas Institute of Science and Technology (STIST), Kerala. I have a strong interest in coding, gaming, and exploring new technologies. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems, and I‚Äôm constantly learning new skills to improve as a developer.
        I have experience in Python and C programming, and I‚Äôm currently exploring web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I‚Äôve worked on projects like a Discord bot with music playback and queue management and a personal website, and I‚Äôm currently working on Cartopia, an E-Commerce platform.
        I also enjoy collaborating with friends on tech projects and learning from the community. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer, build innovative software, and contribute to open-source projects.
        Let‚Äôs connect and build something amazing together!</p>

        <p>Cortex is a versatile Discord bot that facilitates music playback and interaction management within a server. It allows users to join voice channels, play songs from YouTube, skip tracks, and leave channels. Songs are queued and played in sequence, with error handling for playback issues. The bot also enables administrators to change its activity status, including options like playing, listening, watching, or streaming, with support for stream URLs. Additionally, all actions, such as joining a voice channel, playing music, or skipping songs, are logged in a designated channel for transparency. Cortex is configured with secure environment variables and offers commands like help and test, ensuring a smooth user experience while maintaining control and visibility for admins.</p>
